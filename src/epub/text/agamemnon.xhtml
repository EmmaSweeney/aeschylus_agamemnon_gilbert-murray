								<span>This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till well I know yon midnight festival</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bearers to man of summer and of snow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.</span>

								<span>That bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passionèd!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And when I turn me to my bed⁠—my bed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To close may close too well to wake again;</span>
								<br/>

								<span>O kindler of the dark, O daylight birth</span>

								<span>Of dawn and dancing upon Argive earth</span>

								<br/>
								<span>If verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>And I myself will tread the dance before</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Good, and mine own to-night three sixes plain. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Lights begin to show in the Palace.</i></span>

								<br/>
								<span>I speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Across my tongue. But these stone walls know well,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.</span>
